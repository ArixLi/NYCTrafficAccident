    "text": "2.1 Description\nThe data consist of countrywide car accidents that covers 49 states of the USA. The accident data were collected from February 2016 to March 2023, using multiple APIs that provide streaming traffic incident (or event) data. These APIs broadcast traffic data captured by various entities, including the US and state departments of transportation, law enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and traffic sensors within the road networks. The dataset currently contains approximately 7.7 million accident records.\nSobhan Moosavi collected and updated this dataset (Fully Accessable Here) with his collaborators almost every year (we use the latest one that is published at March 2023), according to the papers “A Countrywide Traffic Accident Dataset.” [Visit Paper] and “Accident Risk Prediction based on Heterogeneous Sparse Data: New Dataset and Insights.” [Visit Paper].\nFor the purpose of our investigation, we exclusively utilize accident data specific to New York City, encompassing its boroughs—Bronx, Queens, New York, Richmond and Kings. This dataset comprises a substantial 117,817 entries, each encompassing a comprehensive set of 46 variables. These variables encapsulate crucial information such as the temporal aspects, geographic coordinates, descriptive narratives, and other miscellaneous features characterizing each accident incident. The entirety of this extensive dataset is conveniently stored in a CSV file denoted as “NY_Accidents_March23.csv.”\nThe geographical details are meticulously encoded through longitude and latitude coordinates, providing a nuanced representation of the accident locations during distinct time frames. Complementary to this, the dataset encompasses computed distance metrics and timestamp information. Additionally, there exists a set of factor-like variables that categorically classify the common reasons for traffic accidents, offering a detailed contextualization of the incidents.\nFacilitating a seamless integration into our analysis pipeline, the dataset is thoughtfully organized by its authors. Our approach involves the straightforward download of this dataset, followed by its importation into the R environment using the “read.csv()” function. This meticulous organization ensures that we can efficiently access and analyze the wealth of information encapsulated within the dataset, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of traffic accidents within the diverse landscape of New York City."

    "section": "2.3 Missing value analysis",
    "text": "2.3 Missing value analysis\n\nWe will first analyze possible missing values in our dataset. For our main goal, Spatial Variation in Accident Density and Comparative Analysis of Boroughs, we need to check the portion of valid data in the whole set.\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(reshape2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(redav)\ndata &lt;- read.csv('../NY_Accidents_March23.csv')\n\nposition &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  select(County, Start_Lat, Start_Lng, End_Lat, End_Lng)\n\nplot_missing(position)\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmv_summary &lt;- position %&gt;%\n    group_by(County) %&gt;%\n    summarize(\n        Start_Lat_missing = mean(is.na(Start_Lat)),\n        Start_Lng_missing = mean(is.na(Start_Lng)),\n        End_Lat_missing = mean(is.na(End_Lat)),\n        End_Lng_missing = mean(is.na(End_Lng))\n    )\nmv_summary &lt;- pivot_longer(mv_summary, cols = -County, names_to = \"Indicator\", values_to = \"Value\")\nggplot(mv_summary, aes(x = Indicator, y = County, fill = Value)) +\n  geom_tile(color = \"white\") +\n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"lightblue\", high = \"black\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Heatmap of Indicators by County\", x = \"Indicator\", y = \"County\")\n\n\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, our analysis of the dataset reveals notable variations in the prevalence of missing values across different geographic regions and specific columns. Particularly, the “End_Lat” and “End_Lng” columns exhibit a significant number of missing values. Richmond stands out with a considerably high missing value proportion, reaching 0.444. In contrast, Queens, New York, Kings, and Bronx show a more comparable range of 0.35-0.4 in terms of missing value proportions for these columns.\nIt is noteworthy that there are no missing values in the “Start_Lat” and “Start_Lng” columns. Consequently, for our research purposes, relying on the start positions becomes imperative for drawing density patterns. The disparities in missing value proportions underscore the importance of considering regional variations when interpreting and utilizing the data. By focusing on the available information in the “Start_Lat” and “Start_Lng” columns, we can still glean valuable insights into the density patterns of the incidents under investigation.\n\nSecond, for Contributing Factors, we would like to see if there is missing value for the reason of the accident. It may possible for an accident without a clear conclusion about its fault or it may not very common, which could leads a deeper research in the future.\n\n\n\nCode\nreason &lt;- data[, c(14, 30:42)]\nreason[, -1] &lt;- lapply(reason[, -1], as.logical)\n\nreason$TrueCount &lt;- rowSums(reason[, -1])\n\n\nreason_stat &lt;- reason %&gt;%\n  group_by(County) %&gt;%\n  summarize(\n    Non_Common = sum(TrueCount == 0) / n(),\n    Single_Factor = sum(TrueCount == 1) / n(),\n    Multiple_Factor = sum(TrueCount &gt; 1) / n()\n  )\n\nrs_long &lt;- gather(reason_stat, key = \"Factors\", value = \"Fraction\", -County)\nfrac_order &lt;- rev(names(reason_stat)[2:ncol(reason_stat)])\nrs_long$Factors &lt;- factor(rs_long$Factors, levels = frac_order)\n\n\nggplot(rs_long, aes(x = County, y = Fraction, fill = Factors)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"fill\", color = \"white\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  guides(fill = guide_legend(title = NULL)) +\n  labs(title = \"Fraction of Accident Factors\", x = \"County\", y = \"Fraction\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 100))\n\n\n\n\n\nIn our dataset, we observe that approximately half of the recorded traffic accidents in New York City are distributed among the five counties, namely Bronx, Queens, New York, Richmond, and Kings. It is noteworthy, however, that the county of Kings stands out with the highest incidence of accidents attributed to multiple contributing factors. Despite this variation, the individual fractions of accidents within each area are relatively similar.\nThis intriguing pattern prompts the possibility of conducting a more in-depth investigation into the underlying factors contributing to traffic accidents. By delving into the specific factors associated with accidents, we may uncover unique insights and patterns that could inform targeted interventions for improving road safety.\nFor this future research endeavor, it is important to highlight that we retain more than half of the original dataset, providing a substantial foundation for analyzing the contributing factors in these traffic accidents. This ample dataset ensures that our analysis remains robust and comprehensive, offering a solid basis for understanding the nuances of traffic accidents across the diverse landscape of New York City."

    "section": "3.1 Contributing Factors",
    "text": "3.1 Contributing Factors\nThe investigation focuses on discerning patterns in contributing factors influencing traffic accidents in NYC. Initially, we aim to identify prevalent factors contributing to these incidents. Subsequently, an exploration ensues to ascertain potential associations between these contributing factors and variables such as Visibility, Wind’s Direction, and Wind’s Speed. This analytic approach aims to unveil underlying relationships and enhance our understanding of the multifaceted dynamics that influence traffic accidents in the city. By examining the interplay of contributing factors with weather-related variables, we seek to provide valuable insights that contribute to a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing road safety in the urban context.\n\nFactors Association\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(corrplot)\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(reshape2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(lubridate)\nlibrary(redav)\ndata &lt;- read.csv('../NY_Accidents_March23.csv')\nreason &lt;- data[, c(14, 30:42)]\nreason[, -1] &lt;- lapply(reason[, -1], as.logical)\ncor_matrix &lt;- cor(reason[, 2:14])\nggplot(melt(cor_matrix), aes(Var1, Var2, fill = value)) +\n  geom_tile(color = \"white\") +\n  scale_fill_gradient2(low = \"blue\", high = \"red\", mid = \"white\", midpoint = 0) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Association Between Contributing Factors\") +\n  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(),\n        axis.title.y = element_blank())\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the association heat map, two variables stand out as peculiar: “Turning_Loop” and “Roundabout.” Both variables exhibit only one value (False in this case). Consequently, we can safely exclude these two variables from our subsequent analysis, as their singular values do not contribute meaningfully to our research outcomes. This strategic decision allows us to focus on the variables that offer more variation and potential impact on our results.\n\n\nCode\ncor_matrix_new &lt;- cor(reason[, c(2:8, 10:13)])\ncorrplot(cor_matrix_new, method = \"color\", addCoef.col = \"black\")\n\n\n\n\n\nMoreover, a quantitative analysis through a graph provides clearer insights. Notably, the variable “Crossing” exhibits a strong correlation with “Traffic_Signal,” which is logical given the intricate scenarios at intersections where drivers must adhere to traffic signals to prevent accidents. Additionally, “Traffic_Calming” and “Bump” show some association, as the presence of additional traffic calming measures increases the likelihood of encountering a bump, whether it involves interactions between vehicles or with these barriers. On the contrary, several factors, such as “Give_Away,” “Junction,” and “No_Exit,” lack a discernible association with others.\n\nTop-3 Factors Pattern\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggalluvial)\ncolumn_sums &lt;- colSums(reason[, 2:14])\ntop_3 &lt;- names(sort(column_sums, decreasing = TRUE)[1:3])\ntop_3_reason &lt;- reason[, c(\"County\", top_3)]\n\ntop_3_reason &lt;- top_3_reason %&gt;%\n  gather(Factors, Value, -County) %&gt;%\n  filter(Value == TRUE) %&gt;%\n  select(County, Factors)\n\ntop_3_reason_cur &lt;- top_3_reason[1:1000,]\nggplot(top_3_reason_cur, aes(axis1 = County, axis2 = Factors)) +\n  geom_alluvium(aes(fill = Factors)) +\n  geom_stratum(aes(fill = County)) +\n  geom_text(stat = \"stratum\", aes(label = after_stat(stratum))) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Alluvial Plot: County to Factors\")\n\n\n\n\n\nGiven the huge data amount of our dataset, we have opted to visualize only the top-3 contributing factors using the ggalluvium plot. In conjunction with the previously presented graphs, it becomes evident that to mitigate traffic accidents effectively, governmental focus and resources should be directed towards enhancing the safety and maintenance of crossing, junction, and traffic signal infrastructure across all listed areas in NYC. These factors not only significantly contribute to accidents but also exhibit interconnectedness, as seen in the relationship between crossing and traffic signals.\n\nQuantitative Factors\n\nWe would like to further research on some other quantitative factors, to see if there is some distribution difference in different logic factors.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggridges)\nlibrary(tidyr)\ndata &lt;- read.csv('../NY_Accidents_March23.csv')\nq_reason &lt;- data[, c(21, 23:25, 27, 30:42)]\ncolumn_sums &lt;- colSums(q_reason[, 6:18])\ntop_9 &lt;- names(sort(column_sums, decreasing = TRUE)[1:9])\n\nvis &lt;- q_reason[, c(\"Visibility.mi.\", top_9)]\n\nlong_vis &lt;- gather(vis, key = \"Factors\", value = \"Value\", 2:10)\n\nggplot(long_vis, aes(y = Value, x = Visibility.mi.)) +\n  geom_density_ridges() +\n  facet_wrap(~ Factors, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Ridge graph of Visibility by Factors\")\n\n\n\n\n\nWhile there may be an initial inclination to attribute accidents to visibility issues, our ridge density graphs reveal that the top nine common factor labels in traffic accidents do not exhibit discernible differences in visibility distribution between True and False cases.\n\n\nCode\ntem &lt;- q_reason[, c(\"Temperature.F.\", top_9)]\n\nlong_tem &lt;- gather(tem, key = \"Factors\", value = \"Value\", 2:10)\n\nggplot(long_tem, aes(y = Value, x = Temperature.F.)) +\n  geom_density_ridges() +\n  facet_wrap(~ Factors, scales = \"free_y\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Ridge graph of Temperature by Factors\")\n\n\n\n\n\nHowever, we observe variations concerning temperature. Specifically, we note that temperatures tend to concentrate in two extremes, indicating that both cold and hot weather conditions may have an impact on road conditions and drivers’ concentration, which lead to a traffic accident associated with this factor label."

Although the data collection extends only until March 2023, it is plausible to anticipate that “Crossing” will retain its leading position for the entire year.\nDespite this consistency in the top-ranking location, there is a lack of significant temporal changes for major factor labels throughout these years. This suggests that the data collection process for traffic accidents is robust and provides a stable statistical foundation. Furthermore, this stability underscores the need for continued vigilance by both the government and the community, aligning their efforts with the ranking depicted in the graph to effectively address and mitigate the significant impact of traffic accidents."

Particularly noteworthy is a sudden spike in 2022, resulting in a significant increase in traffic accident occurrences and subsequent societal losses. In Queens, a slight decrease is evident in 2018, but attention should be directed to Richmond, where the order of accident numbers deviates from the overall trend, as previously indicated in the graph.\nRichmond presents a peculiar pattern from 2017 to 2021, resembling a “U” shape and resulting in a bimodal distribution. This anomaly is tentatively attributed to potential issues with data collection. Despite utilizing monthly averages for each year, there is a notable decrease in 2023. It’s crucial to consider that our data collection only extends until March of this year, and as we’ve established earlier, traffic accidents are less frequent from October to April of the following year.\n\nSeverity Analysis in Different Area\n\nWe would also like to analysis the Severity distribution and their potential cause in 5 different areas.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nsever_data &lt;- data[, c(3, 14, 30:42)]\nsever_data &lt;- sever_data %&gt;%\n  mutate(TrueCount = rowSums(select(., 3:15) == TRUE))\n\nheatmap_data &lt;- sever_data %&gt;%\n  group_by(County, Severity, TrueCount) %&gt;%\n  summarise(Count = n())\n  \nggplot(heatmap_data, aes(x = TrueCount, y = Severity, fill = Count)) +\n  geom_tile() +\n  scale_fill_viridis_c() +\n  facet_wrap(~ County) +\n  labs(title = \"Heatmap of Severity vs Factors by County\",\n       x = \"Factors Count\",\n       y = \"Severity\",\n       fill = \"Count\")\n\n\n\n\n\nAnalyzing the heatmap, we observe a consistent pattern in the distribution of factor labels across different severities. In all areas, the majority of traffic accidents occur with 0-1 factor labels and severity levels 2-3. This finding reinforces the notion that attributing the severity of traffic accidents to specific areas might not be a significant factor. As a result, our primary focus should be on understanding and addressing the spatial density distribution of traffic accidents in NYC."

    "text": "After a thorough research into New York City’s traffic accidents, we now have a better understanding of the traffic accidents across different boroughs in New York City, the factors contributing to the accidents, and we are able to answer the key questions of our interests.\nThe traffic accidents vary across different boroughs of NYC in which Queens has relatively higher counts of traffic accidents across 2016-2023. According to our interactive Choropleth map, the traffic accident density is densed in certain blocks which are the exit of George Washington Bridge, the right side of Alexander Hamilton Bridge, the left side of Queens-Midtown Tunnel, etc.\nThe primary contribution factors to traffic accidents are notably Crossing, Traffic_Signal, and Junction. According to our ridgeline plot, the extreme weathers also contribute to traffic accidents where traffic accidents are peaked in relatively cold or warm weathers.\nThe quantity of traffic accidents do vary with time where it varies with month of the year and with years, The number of traffic accidents tends to increase over 2016-2022 and is peaked at 2022. Since the data only included accidents until March 2023, we are expecting the number of accidents of 2023 ends up higher than 2022. In our interactive d3 graph, it’s easy to see that the number of accidents caused by top three factors peaks at May and is relative high until October. Counter-intuitively, the number of accidents are lower when in winter where we expect road conditions to be bad. One of the reasons could be people tend to concentrate and be careful when they know that driving in winter is dangerous. The reasons behind this trend over month of the year is another interesting topic needing further analysis and research. However, the reasons causing traffic accidents do not vary with different boroughs of NYC.\nThe research has a few limitations such as the data collection where we have missing values of geological information, and for half of the accidents, we are missing the factors causing it. Thus, it is imperative to retreat those informations.\nFurther research could focus on the factors causing the traffic accidents in a way that we consider more specific factors instead of a few main factors in our dataset. Besides, the reason why traffic accidents are higher in summer than in winter is worth exploring, and this would be another aspect of future research,\nIn conclusion, when you drive in New York City, you should be extremely careful when in summer, when in Queens, when entering or exiting a bridge, when crossing, waiting for signal, and encountering a junction."
