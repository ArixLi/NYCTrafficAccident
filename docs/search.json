    "section": "2.3 Missing value analysis",
    "text": "2.3 Missing value analysis\n\nWe will first analyze possible missing values in our dataset. For our main goal, Spatial Variation in Accident Density and Comparative Analysis of Boroughs, we need to check the portion of valid data in the whole set.\n\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(ggplot2)\nlibrary(reshape2)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(tidyr)\nlibrary(redav)\ndata &lt;- read.csv('../NY_Accidents_March23.csv')\n\nposition &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  select(County, Start_Lat, Start_Lng, End_Lat, End_Lng)\n\nplot_missing(position)\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nmv_summary &lt;- position %&gt;%\n    group_by(County) %&gt;%\n    summarize(\n        Start_Lat_missing = mean(is.na(Start_Lat)),\n        Start_Lng_missing = mean(is.na(Start_Lng)),\n        End_Lat_missing = mean(is.na(End_Lat)),\n        End_Lng_missing = mean(is.na(End_Lng))\n    )\nmv_summary &lt;- pivot_longer(mv_summary, cols = -County, names_to = \"Indicator\", values_to = \"Value\")\nggplot(mv_summary, aes(x = Indicator, y = County, fill = Value)) +\n  geom_tile(color = \"white\") +\n  scale_fill_gradient(low = \"lightblue\", high = \"black\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(title = \"Heatmap of Indicators by County\", x = \"Indicator\", y = \"County\")\n\n\n\n\n\nIn conclusion, our analysis of the dataset reveals notable variations in the prevalence of missing values across different geographic regions and specific columns. Particularly, the “End_Lat” and “End_Lng” columns exhibit a significant number of missing values. Richmond stands out with a considerably high missing value proportion, reaching 0.444. In contrast, Queens, New York, Kings, and Bronx show a more comparable range of 0.35-0.4 in terms of missing value proportions for these columns.\nIt is noteworthy that there are no missing values in the “Start_Lat” and “Start_Lng” columns. Consequently, for our research purposes, relying on the start positions becomes imperative for drawing density patterns. The disparities in missing value proportions underscore the importance of considering regional variations when interpreting and utilizing the data. By focusing on the available information in the “Start_Lat” and “Start_Lng” columns, we can still glean valuable insights into the density patterns of the incidents under investigation.\n\nSecond, for Contributing Factors, we would like to see if there is missing value for the reason of the accident. It may possible for an accident without a clear conclusion about its fault or it may not very common, which could leads a deeper research in the future.\n\n\n\nCode\nreason &lt;- data[, c(14, 30:42)]\nreason[, -1] &lt;- lapply(reason[, -1], as.logical)\n\nreason$TrueCount &lt;- rowSums(reason[, -1])\n\n\nreason_stat &lt;- reason %&gt;%\n  group_by(County) %&gt;%\n  summarize(\n    Non_Common = sum(TrueCount == 0) / n(),\n    Single_Factor = sum(TrueCount == 1) / n(),\n    Multiple_Factor = sum(TrueCount &gt; 1) / n()\n  )\n\nrs_long &lt;- gather(reason_stat, key = \"Factors\", value = \"Fraction\", -County)\nfrac_order &lt;- rev(names(reason_stat)[2:ncol(reason_stat)])\nrs_long$Factors &lt;- factor(rs_long$Factors, levels = frac_order)\n\n\nggplot(rs_long, aes(x = County, y = Fraction, fill = Factors)) +\n  geom_bar(stat = \"identity\", position = \"fill\", color = \"white\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  guides(fill = guide_legend(title = NULL)) +\n  labs(title = \"Fraction of Accident Factors\", x = \"County\", y = \"Fraction\") +\n  theme(axis.text.x = element_text(angle = 45, hjust = 1)) +\n  scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent_format(scale = 100))\n\n\n\n\n\nIn our dataset, we observe that approximately half of the recorded traffic accidents in New York City are distributed among the five counties, namely Bronx, Queens, New York, Richmond, and Kings. It is noteworthy, however, that the county of Kings stands out with the highest incidence of accidents attributed to multiple contributing factors. Despite this variation, the individual fractions of accidents within each area are relatively similar.\nThis intriguing pattern prompts the possibility of conducting a more in-depth investigation into the underlying factors contributing to traffic accidents. By delving into the specific factors associated with accidents, we may uncover unique insights and patterns that could inform targeted interventions for improving road safety.\nFor this future research endeavor, it is important to highlight that we retain more than half of the original dataset, providing a substantial foundation for analyzing the contributing factors in these traffic accidents. This ample dataset ensures that our analysis remains robust and comprehensive, offering a solid basis for understanding the nuances of traffic accidents across the diverse landscape of New York City."
