# Data

## Description

The data consist of countrywide car accidents that covers 49 states of the USA. The accident data were collected from February 2016 to March 2023, using multiple APIs that provide streaming traffic incident (or event) data. These APIs broadcast traffic data captured by various entities, including the US and state departments of transportation, law enforcement agencies, traffic cameras, and traffic sensors within the road networks. The dataset currently contains approximately 7.7 million accident records. 

Sobhan Moosavi collected and updated this dataset ([Fully Accessable Here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/sobhanmoosavi/us-accidents)) with his collaborators almost every year (we use the latest one that is published at March 2023), according to the papers “A Countrywide Traffic Accident Dataset.” [[Visit Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1906.05409)] and "Accident Risk Prediction based on Heterogeneous Sparse Data: New Dataset and Insights." [[Visit Paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1909.09638)]. 

For the purpose of our investigation, we exclusively utilize accident data specific to New York City, encompassing its five boroughs—Bronx, Queens, Manhattan, Brooklyn, and Staten Island. This dataset comprises a substantial 136,202 entries, each encompassing a comprehensive set of 47 variables. These variables encapsulate crucial information such as the temporal aspects, geographic coordinates, descriptive narratives, and other miscellaneous features characterizing each accident incident. The entirety of this extensive dataset is conveniently stored in a CSV file denoted as "NYC_Accidents_March23.csv."

The geographical details are meticulously encoded through longitude and latitude coordinates, providing a nuanced representation of the accident locations during distinct time frames. Complementary to this, the dataset encompasses computed distance metrics and timestamp information. Additionally, there exists a set of factor-like variables that categorically classify the common reasons for traffic accidents, offering a detailed contextualization of the incidents.

Facilitating a seamless integration into our analysis pipeline, the dataset is thoughtfully organized by its authors. Our approach involves the straightforward download of this dataset, followed by its importation into the R environment using the "read.csv()" function. This meticulous organization ensures that we can efficiently access and analyze the wealth of information encapsulated within the dataset, contributing to a more comprehensive understanding of traffic accidents within the diverse landscape of New York City.
